## First you take it, then you make it

For every piece of food you've ate, someone had to make it. For every piece of clothes you wear, someone had to make it. For every piece of software you use, someone had to make it. Right now, I'm learning how to be the person to make, rather than to take. There's a lot that you can learn from making, since you have an almost unlimited amount of angles you can tackle a problem. In my ICS 314 class my professor accepts majority of solutions that work as long as they abide by the constraints. I really like making, since I have a lot of ideas and how I can modify them, but these ideas were only allowed to exist due to the amount that I have been able to take.

## The Art of Consuming

Most people won't think much of anything while consuming media. Maybe you'll get a couple of words like, "Wow," or "That's neat," but I think the best form of media you can consume is something that really makes you think things such as, "How did they do that?" or "This gives me a good idea." This brings us to software engineering. We really haven't gotten anywhere in today's world by just being complacent of where we are today. Most things are a result of a need for improvement, or of a creative idea. An early form of transportation used horses to pull humans to their destination automatically, and was later improved upon to remove the horses and replace it with motors that humans use themselves, and was then later improved to go right back to the horses with Tesla. I imagine that most software engineers look at software and can get irked by drawbacks or think to themself, "Why didn't they do it this way?" I think it's important to view other's approaches to production while consuming a product or media while also considering to yourself what you think of it.

## Do You Think Carpenters Make Their Own Chairs?

I believe that the ideal software engineer is the one that would make the product for the consumer. Sadly, that's not very common today. At the moment, I don't have enough skills and knowledge to put a user experience first when I can barely make the product work in the first place. I think managing time is important too, to make sure there's enough time to improve upon a finished product, but while also using as little time as possible to make a maximum amount of time for other non-necessary. If possible, I would love to produce something I would use myself, not because I made it, but because it's something genuinely useful.
