<h2 id="learning-how-to-walk">Learning how to walk</h2>

<p>Using FreeCodeCamp as a resource to help me learn the basics of Javascript was an incredibly valuable tool. I think that their approach to teaching coding was extremely smart, as they lay down the basics so that even a grade schooler could understand it.  That’s not to say it’s easy however. They give easy concepts that you can conceptually wrap your head around but translate it into the language that is Javascript and I found that these broken down lessons that let you interact with the language really helped me understand it, rather than watching boring lectures that simply talk about concepts.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-even-like-walking">Do I even like walking?</h2>

<p>Everyone’s had to learn a new skill at a point, whether it be learning how to derive variables from high level math equations on the day of the final, or simply walking. While everyone’s experience may differ, the one thing that stays consistent between these skills, that I’ve found, is the foundation on which we learn how to accomplish these tasks. In the sense of learning Javascript, I drew on my experiences of Python, and Java; and in those instances I drew upon my knowledge of using Scratch in intermediate school; and in that instance I drew upon my basic sense of direction; and so on. Luckily, I found that Javascript was not so different from my experience with Python and Java, so I had a relatively easy time understanding how everything worked and functioned.</p>

<p>Would I prefer it over other languages? I’m not too sure yet. My first impressions were that it was much more flexible in how it handled functions from something like the strict C language or how data types within variables such as “int” and “long” are no longer. A big difference from other languages that I’ve seen so far is that many of these nuances are dealt with away from my view and I’m simply left to deal with the main bulk of figuring out the logic. I’m still cautiously optimistic on what I can accomplish with Javascript but I feel as though it shouldn’t take too much longer for me to find out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-competitive-walking">Wait, competitive walking?</h2>

<p>It’s simple enough to write a program in your spare time, or whenever that defunct lightbulb finally works. But to make something, that’s not your idea? In a certain amount of time? And it has to work? These are only some of the constraints we are learning to overcome in this class of ICS 314. Luckily, we aren’t being thrown into the fire without a life preserver, we at least get to prepare.</p>

<p>The practice WODs provided, although not 1 to 1 with the real WODs we do in class, provide enough practice and enough insight to me that I at least know I’m not behind. Yet. The relief of looking at a practice WOD and actually being able to make a small prototype in my head in seconds really lets me know that I’m prepared and confident enough to tackle the upcoming WODs. Remember when I talked about drawing experience? We did a practice WOD in class about converting temperature from fahrenheit to celsius and I really don’t think I could have done it without practicing our first practice WOD. Not because I wouldn’t know how to do it, I don’t think I gained any more knowledge in between those attempts, but because I wouldn’t think I could do it.</p>

<h2 id="im-already-tired">I’m already tired</h2>

<p>Javascript isn’t easy, but at least it’s not C.</p>
