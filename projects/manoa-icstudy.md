For my ICS 314 final project, I was tasked to work with a team to develop a website around a problem of our choosing. Our team chose to tackle the problem of ICS students not learning subjects and topics well enough, whether it be due to professors or an inability to wrap their head around a concept. Our website makes it easy to create sessions with other students that have taken the course or are taking it. For this project we used React and Meteor to develop the website. We also used an issue driven project management style to divy up the workload and focus on certain tasks.

I learned a lot about working with a team on a project like this and had a really great time with all of my team members.
