Sony Vegas is a video editing software made for video creators to edit and export videos. It has many tools to manipulate video and audio, and also has a seamless and smooth interface.

I used Sony Vegas to edit together multiple video clips I took on my trip to New York in my Science Olympiad Nationals tournament. I sadly won't be able to share any of the clips or videos out of privacy of the people I was with, as I shared it only to them. I can however speak about my experience with it and what I learned about creating videos and editing that I did not know prior to even filming.

Before filming anything, I did not know anything about the video process or vlogs in general. I just wanted to record our experience on the trip so we could look back on it later. Throughout the trip I found myself having new ideas of how I could fit everything together, from having people do transitions for me or little interviews in the middle of recordings. However, many of these clips had no cohesion with each other and on some days there would be almost no footage, or too much footage. It was also pretty difficult to record the experience while also having my first priority to perform well in the tournament, so the video quality suffered from it
